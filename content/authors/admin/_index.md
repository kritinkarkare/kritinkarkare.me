Kritin Karkare found that she really liked hot chocolate at an early age and never gave it up. She is currently a staff research associate specializing in bioinformatics at the University of California, San Diego Biology Instructional Labs, helping set up lab classes with materials and operating the Illumina MiSeq DNA Sequencing machine. 

She's also a transgender girl and uses she/her pronouns. She is half thai and half indian and extremely proud of it! She also does science writing on the side, along with developing science communication programs for undergrads. She's happy that she still gets to play in the Intermission Orchestra at UCSD and can conduct her favorite pieces!
