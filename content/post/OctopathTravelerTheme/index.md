Hi all! Last Spring, my friend Joseph arranged the Octopath Traveler Main Theme for our Intermission Orchestra at UCSD and I helped rehearse and conduct it for the concert. The video just went up, so I've attached it below. Check it out and leave a comment or a like if you will - and if you want to hear more of our music, subscribe!
