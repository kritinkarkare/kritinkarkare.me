Super well written and concise! It tells me who (the four research institutes), the what (they received a donation from Padres Pedal the Cause), when (thursday evening), where (at the Salk Institute) and why (for cancer research) in just one sentence. It gives apt description of what the research institutes, some insight into how the donation will be used, and some history into the Padres Pedal the Cause and their events. I also liked the introduction into the attendee that Monica covered, and especially how she wrapped up the story with what the content of the story means to her interviewee. I think that's an important point because it shows the motivation for attending the event for the people in her piece.

My only suggestion I think is to use sub headlines to section out parts of the story! I should have used some in my mine, and thinking back they're a good way for organizing points.

Awesome job! I'll also check out the Hemingway app site.
