For our progressive feature story assignment #1, Professor Mendoza tasked us to write the lede for our feature story. I chose to write it on SARS and the very relevant Covid-19. At the time of writing, Covid-19 was just beginning its foray into the United States. I was unaware of just how much impact it would have only a few weeks later (this is written on March 15th, 2020)

“What if you checked into a hotel expecting to enjoy a wedding, but wound up too ill the next day? Seems plausible. But what if that same illness took your life just two weeks later, and then wound up taking 773 others within 9 months? In late 2002, the SARS virus (Severe-Acute respiratory syndrome) began its sojourn to overrun the world. Because such a disease traveled so fast, understanding how it functioned internally became vital to saving lives. With the aid of genome sequencing, scientists eventually developed treatments based on the order of SARS DNA. But in late 2019, a sibling to SARS called COVID-19 has taken over 2300 peoples’ lives. What could go better? Here is a cautionary tale of two terrors not to be trifled with, one of which has been conquered, and the other still on its conquest, and some of the science and technology that researchers use to tackle these insurmountable challenges.
